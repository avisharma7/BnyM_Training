Day-2

New features added in java 8
1)	Functional programming
2)	Lambda expressions  required for android programming
3)	Streams API  used in multithreading, helps to achieve concurency

Interfaces in java
1) all the methods in java are public and abstract by default
2) in abstract class, methods with implementation can be written
3) abstract class has abstract as well as concrete methods, but interfaces have only abstract methods

List is a interface where stream api methods is there

Interface can be used to implement multiple inheritance in  java

static methods are allowed in java 8
static methods can be called  using class or interface name

STREAM API
When you use stream api, you just have to focus on what to do, not how to do

#Different Methods in stream API

#Java Lambda helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.
Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface
An interface which has only one abstract method is called functional interface.
Java provides an anotation @FunctionalInterface,
which is used to declare an interface as functional interface.
Why use Lambda Expression?
1) To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
2) Less coding.

-> Lambda expression only works with functional interface

#Stream API
1) stream are used to filter, collect, print, and convert from one data structure to other etc

# Method references

Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8. Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface.
 It is compact and easy form of lambda expression.

 Types of Method References

 Reference to a static method.
 Reference to an instance method.
 Reference to a constructor.
